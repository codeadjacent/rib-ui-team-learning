If you haven completed the setup in the [root readme](../../README.md), please do it first.

## Course Information

**Course**: [The Complete Guide to Angular](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/?src=sac&kw=angular&couponCode=CM251223G1)
**Platform**: Udemy

## Purpose

This project folder is dedicated to the "Complete Guide to Angular" course. It is a space for team members to follow along with the course, complete exercises, and build the course project.

## Instructions

1.  Create your personal folder inside this directory (simple use `ng new your_name)
2.  Use your personal folder to store your progress, course notes, and code.
3.  Feel free to peek at your colleagues' folders to compare solutions or learn different approaches!
4.  Use the README.md in your personal folder to track your progress.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i -g @angular/cli` to update your local angular to latest
2. Run `ng new [your name]`
    1. Select Tailwind CSS or SCSS
    2. SSR no
    3. AI none (you supposed to learn angular and not let AI do it :D )
3. Install Plugin Angular Language Service (VSCode)

## Progress tracking

Copy the two markdown list below to the README file of your created angular project and add a checkmark, when you are finished with a section (including course excersies and personal experimentations).
