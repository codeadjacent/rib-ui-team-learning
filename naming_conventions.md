# Frontend & Angular Naming Conventions

This document establishes the mandatory naming conventions for all frontend software engineering tasks. Adherence to these rules is required to ensure readability, maintainability, and seamless collaboration across the team.

## 1. General Coding Standards

These rules apply globally to all code written within the project, including TypeScript logic and general file structures.

### 1.1 Language

- **Must** write all naming in English.

### 1.2 Abbreviations

- **Must Not** use abbreviations that are not universally understood.
- **Can** use specific allowed exceptions: `init`, `min`, `max`, `ms` (SI Units).
- **Must Not** use ambiguous abbreviations (e.g., `vc` which could mean "vehicle class" or "venture capital").
    - **Why:** To ensure universal readability for people not familiar with the subject matter.

### 1.3 Casing Styles

- **Must** use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants and enums.
- **Must** use **PascalCase** for Classes, Interfaces, and Types.
- **Must** use **camelCase** for class members (properties) and functions.
- **Must** use **kebab-case** for file names, CSS classes, and HTML attributes.
    - **Exception:** Autogenerated files (e.g., from ORMs) **Can** be PascalCase.

### 1.4 Booleans

- **Must** prefix boolean variables and methods returning booleans with a questioning verb: `is`, `has`, `show`, or `enable`,...
- **Must Not** apply this rule to validation functions (these should return `null` if valid or an error constant if not).
    - **Why:** Increases readability since booleans are often used as part of expressions.
    - **Example:** `isVisible`, `hasAccess`, `enableSubmit`.

### 1.5 Physical Values (SI Units)

- **Must** postfix variables representing physical values with their SI Unit.
    - **Why:** Reduces the chance of interpretation or calculation error.
    - **Example:**
        - `delay` → `delayMS`
